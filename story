You left your house,early in the morning,you suddenly remember you forgot to take your id..(do you want to turn around and get it back? Yes,you turn around and get it back--No you just continue walking)
If Yes: you went and took your id.
If No: you continued walking.

Walking on the streets with music in your ears,you notice a person standing next to his car,it’s obvious that they need help..you hesitate helping them,thinking that you have to be at Codi before 8:45,so that Gaby won’t reduce some of your keys,but you decide to help them cause you are a nice person :)

When you approached them they immediately point their gun towards you and says “Get in the car you piece of shit!” (what will you do??? Do you?
1-Fight => it’s impossible to fight cause there is a gun pointed at you => what will you do?
2-Cry => touch the killer feelings =>understand what they want from you (wants your identity => if you have it from previous question,you'll give it to him and you are free to go,arrive to Codi at the right time,tell the story and no one believes you,and Gaby give you minus keys anyway--if you don’t have it,get killed => GAME OVER) 
3-Scream => you start screaming for help,a police officer hears you,they come to help => Free to go! 
4-Try to escape => you try to run from the killer,the killer shoots you,you're dead..and lost all the keys because you did not show up at Codi eventually!! GAME OVER.
5-Pretend to faint => you pretend to faint,the killer get confused,(do you want to stay pretending to be fainted until the killer leaves,or do you want to wait,maybe they’ll approach you,and you try to hit him?
Stay fainted => the killer just shoots you anyway,and you never show up to Codi,and Gaby gives you minus 10 keys.
Wait => the killer approaches you tries to slap your face to make sure you are really fainted,you hold his hand, bite it,you wake up from your nightmare,find out you were just dreaming,look at the clock and see you’re so late to Codi,so Gaby gives you minus keys!!
